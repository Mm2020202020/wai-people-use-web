## Noor, teenager who is deaf and blind

> I love watching videos and when they have captions that I can make large, I can follow the dialogue.

Noor is a teenager who was born deaf and with typical vision. She recently became legally blind too. Noor has some residual vision and can see small portions of a computer screen when it is significantly enlarged. She communicates using sign language and a portable electronic Braille device.

As a high school senior, Noor is thinking about what she wants to do in the future. She is considering different colleges in the hopes of studying the history of fashion. She is trying to find out about how the college presents teaching material for students and is in contact with a few colleges to discuss captions and transcripts of audio-visual content. She is also keen to understand whether the college websites will work with her Braille display. She has had problems in the past being able to submit coursework because the form buttons weren't recognised by here device. Noorâ€™s portable electronic Braille notetaker includes a calendar, e-mail, web browsing, and note-taking functionality which she wants to make sure can be integrated with the college systems.

Noor enjoys getting out and about with her friends and uses public transport a lot. She will plan out her route before heading out and then use her mobile device to track where she is and where she needs to be. The biggest problem she has with this is that the bus schedules don't respond well to being zoomed. When she enlarges the text it doesn't reflow or wrap properly. This means some of the text gets hidden and she has to scroll a lot around the page. Maps can be really hard as well but she does have an app that gives route instructions in text as well as displaying the route on a map.

Some of the places, particularly galleries, that Noor visits have started implementing beacons that her mobile can pick up. These are fantastic as they help Noor know where she is but also provide information about the displays that are more useful for her. She has emailed her local transport providers to suggest that these would make life easier for her if they were included in stations and at stops.

### Barrier examples

Consistent layout
: **Problem:** Some shopping sites I visit have completely different styles for different sections. It takes me a while to work out where everything is in each section which is really frustrating.
: **Works well:** The shopping website I use has the same layout on all of it's sections which makes it easy to work my way around pages

No transcript
: **Problem:** Some videos only have embedded captions which I can't access easily
: **Works well:** Having a transcript is a big help. It is much easier for me to read with my Braille device

Inaccessible CAPTCHA
: **Problem:** If a site has a CAPTCHA that uses images or audio then I just can't use it - it can take me ages to work out the image and I can't hear the audio alternative
: **Works well:** No CAPTCHA is best but sometimes there are simple things that ask a really easy question

Keyboard navigation
: **Problem:** A date picker that pops up when I tab to a date entry field but I can't use the date picker as it doesn't work with the keyboard.
: **Works well:** I can tab through dates in a date picker using my keyboard or I can just enter the date without the date picker.

Changes elsewhere on a page
: **Problem:** I needed to add my previous address into an application form, but nothing happened when I pressed the 'Add new address' button. I don't know where the new address fields might have been added to the page.
: **Works well:** When I press the 'Add new address' button, I am taken to the form fields that have just been added above the button.
