The following stories of people with disabilities using the Web highlight the effect of accessibility barriers and the broader benefits of accessible websites and web tools.

**Note:** The following scenarios are not real people. They do not address every kind of disability.

<mark>_**Draft reviewers:** The icons below will be replaced with photos of the users._</mark>

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Alex, reporter with repetative stress injury](/people-use-web/user-stories-one)<br> Alex has worked as a reporter for more than 20 years. A few years ago he developed a repetitive strain injury that makes it painful to use a mouse and to type for extended periods of time.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Blair, autistic data entry clerk injury](/people-use-web/user-stories-two)<br> In progress

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Ilya, senior staff member who is blind](/people-use-web/user-stories-three)<br> Ilya is blind. She is the chief accountant at an insurance company that uses web-based documents and forms over a corporate intranet. Like many other blind computer users, Ilya does not read Braille.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Lee, online shopper with color blindness](/people-use-web/user-stories-four)<br> Lee was born with deuteranopia and protanopia, commonly referred to as red/green color blindness. He has difficulty distinguishing among items that are red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear kind of a murky brown.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Luis, basketball fan with Down syndrome](/people-use-web/user-stories-five)<br> Luis was born with Down syndrome and has mild to moderate cognitive delay. Due to his distinct facial appearance and difficulties with speech, many people underestimate Luis' intelligence and capabilities.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Martine, older adult student who is hard of hearing](/people-use-web/user-stories-six)<br> Martine is 62 years old and is a mature student, taking online courses. She has been hard of hearing since birth. She learned to lip read as a young child.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Noor, teenager who is deaf and blind](/people-use-web/user-stories-seven)<br> Noor is a teenager who was born deaf and with typical vision. She recently became legally blind too. Noor has some residual vision and can see small portions of a computer screen when it is significantly enlarged. She communicates using sign language and a portable electronic Braille device.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Preety, middle school student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia](/people-use-web/user-stories-eight)<br> Preety is a middle school student who has dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The ADHD makes it hard for her to pay attention and focus on her schoolwork, something she really needs to do to keep up with her classmates. Reading is especially difficult.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss](/people-use-web/user-stories-nine)<br> Yun had a long and successful career as an architect. He delayed retirement until he was in his 70's. Yun always wore glasses but over time, the demands of the close-up work necessary to render architectural drawings strained his eyes to the point that he could only work a couple of hours at a time. The final straw was when he developed a mild hand tremor and found it difficult to maintain the precision required in his line of work.
