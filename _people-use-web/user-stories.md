## Lee, user with color perception deficiency

> I often miss items on sale because it is hard for me to spot the red labels used to show those things. Sometimes filling out the shopping cart forms is tricky because if I leave something out they show it in red and it's hard for me to see it.

Lee was born with deuteranopia and protanopia, commonly referred to as red/green color blindness. He has difficulty distinguishing among items that are red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear kind of a murky brown.

Lee discovered that shopping for clothes online is actually an advantage over going to physical stores. In addition to just showing pictures of items in the various colors offered, his favorite sites include color labels making coordinating what goes together much easier. Sometimes when checking out though, the required fields and error messages are notated with a red outline and Lee has to pay special attention to identify them. He's noticed lately, however, that a lot of sites are getting better about using a secondary notation like an asterisk for required fields and bold text or an arrow pointing to errors. This really helps a lot.

Lee plays in a various fantasy football leagues with his friends and workmates. Sometimes there can be problems with the way these sites use color to differentiate between teams, player positions and whether or not players are selected for his team. As a result, he tends to prefer certain Fantasy Football apps over others which means he has to try and convince friends to play using the same app.

### Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies used

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

There are several accessibility settings on both his computer and mobile that Lee has found can help in different situations. For example, sometimes reducing transparency, increasing contrast, and inverting the colors on the display make subtle color differences stand out more.

* High contrast mode/Dark mode
* Zoom
* Color filters
* **Customized fonts and colors** – changing the font types, sizes, colors, and spacing to make text easier to read. Customization involves browser settings and, for more advanced users, cascading style sheets (CSS) to override the default appearance of web content.

### Barrier examples

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

**Problem:** When I select a color choice there is nothing to help me differentiate between the colors.

**Works well:** Color choices are shown with a descriptive name. The good sites have a link to a slightly longer description of the colour.

**Problem:** When filling out a form online, required fields and errors are marked with a red outline. 

**Works well:** In addition to color, an asterisk or words are used to identify required fields and errors.

**Problem:** When I play an online game, enemies are marked with a red circle and friends marked with a green circle and I can't tell the difference.

**Works well:** Enemies are also marked with a symbol/use a red triangle so I can easily identify them.

**Problem:** When I am reading news articles with data charts, I can't understand the charts as the columns aren't labelled clearly.

**Works well:** The columns are directly labelled or use a texture as well as colour.
