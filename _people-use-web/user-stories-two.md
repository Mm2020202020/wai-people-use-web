## About Blair

<mark><em><strong>Draft reviewers:</strong> This text is only rough notes for now. Your comments are welome on these ideas.</em></mark>

Sometimes people use lots of words on web site links that do not seem to make sense. I think they are metaphors, but Iâ€™m not sure.

If there is a lot going on on a page I find it very hard to focus. Especially if there is noise or video that starts without me doing anything.

Early non-verbal autism - addressed with early childhood support, may still have some issues with communication

Works part-time as a data entry clerk - struggles if the interface changes, or if asked to do tasks that use parts of the system that haven't been used much

Visits a drop in centre to attend a number of groups including peer support, relaxation and film/tv chat

Prefers text based messaging apps - uses them to talk in online games

Experiences anxiety when faced with significant changes

Lives with parents in a separate space, parents help daily with cooking and cleaning. Have been learning how to cook more things - uses videos that show simple straight forward steps. Finds websites that have unclear instructions or descriptions difficult.


> I often miss items on sale because it is hard for me to spot the red labels used to show those things. Sometimes filling out the shopping cart forms is tricky because if I leave something out they show it in red and it's hard for me to see it.

Lee was born with deuteranopia and protanopia, commonly referred to as red/green color blindness. He has difficulty distinguishing among items that are red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear kind of a murky brown.

Lee discovered that shopping for clothes online is actually an advantage over going to physical stores. In addition to just showing pictures of items in the various colors offered, his favorite sites include color labels making coordinating what goes together much easier. Sometimes when checking out though, the required fields and error messages are notated with a red outline and Lee has to pay special attention to identify them. He's noticed lately, however, that a lot of sites are getting better about using a secondary notation like an asterisk for required fields and bold text or an arrow pointing to errors. This really helps a lot.

Lee plays in a various fantasy football leagues with his friends and workmates. Sometimes there can be problems with the way these sites use color to differentiate between teams, player positions and whether or not players are selected for his team. As a result, he tends to prefer certain Fantasy Football apps over others which means he has to try and convince friends to play using the same app.


## Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies used

TBD

## Barrier examples

Non-literal text barrier
: **Problem:** I have difficulty understanding metaphors, acronyms, abbreviations, and words that aren't used in their literal sense.
: **Works well:** Websites that spell everything out and don't use metaphors are easier to understand.

Plain language barrier
: **Problem:** Sites that use "fancy" language or long sentences to describe a simple concept are hard to understand.
: **Works well:** I'm better at understanding the content when the authors just use plain language and simple sentences.

Consistent layout and navigation barrier
: **Problem:** I get confused when I go to a new page and the layout and navigation are different.
: **Works well:** When there is a consistent "look" to the pages on a site, I can learn where things are.

Heading structure barrier
: **Problem:** Long pages that are not broken up into sections are hard to read and understand.
: **Works well:** Descriptive headings that are styled like an outline help me to find what I want and better understand the content.

Moving or blinking content barrier
: **Problem:** Moving or blinking content is very distracting and I can't remember what I wanted to do.
: **Works well:** It's best when sites don't use moving or blinking content but if they do, let me turn it off.
