## Blair, autistic data entry clerk

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

> Sometimes people use lots of words on web site links that do not seem to make sense. I think they are metaphors, but Iâ€™m not sure.

> If there is a lot going on on a page I find it very hard to focus. Especially if there is noise or video that starts without me doing anything.

Early non-verbal autism - addressed with early childhood support, may still have some issues with communication

Works part-time as a data entry clerk - struggles if the interface changes, or if asked to do tasks that use parts of the system that haven't been used much

Visits a drop in centre to attend a number of groups including peer support, relaxation and film/tv chat

Prefers text based messaging apps - uses them to talk in online games

Experiences anxiety when faced with significant changes

Lives with parents in a separate space, parents help daily with cooking and cleaning. Have been learning how to cook more things - uses videos that show simple straight forward steps. Finds websites that have unclear instructions or descriptions difficult.
