## About Blair

<mark><em><strong>Draft reviewers:</strong> This text is only rough notes for now. Your comments are welome on these ideas.</em></mark>

> If there is a lot going on on a page I find it very hard to focus. Especially if there is audio or video that starts without me doing anything.

Blair's autism was diagnosed early because of delays in speech development, sometimes called non-speaking autism. They received a lot of early childhood support which helped Blair develop language and social skills. Blair still has some problems with language, especially when experiencing anxiety.

Blair works part-time as a data entry clerk. Working with a computer is easy for Blair although updates to the data entry application can cause Blair problems if there are significant changes to the interface. This can cause feelings of axiety for Blair if they don't know the change is coming and are given time to adapt. It can also be difficult for Blair if someone asks for some work that means Blair has to use less commonly used tools or parts of the system.

Blair has his own living space in his parent's house. They help with cooking and cleaning but Blair has been learning how to cook more things using online videos. Blair finds the straight forward, practical step-by-step videos really helpful. If the video is full of metaphors, vague language or implied content it can be more difficult to understand. Online written content that is full of metaphors or sarcasm can be similarly difficult because the meaning is not clear.

## Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies used

TBD

## Barrier examples

Non-literal text barrier
: **Problem:** I have difficulty understanding metaphors, acronyms, abbreviations, and words that aren't used in their literal sense.
: **Works well:** Websites that spell everything out and don't use metaphors are easier to understand.

Plain language barrier
: **Problem:** Sites that use "fancy" language or long sentences to describe a simple concept are hard to understand.
: **Works well:** I'm better at understanding the content when the authors just use plain language and simple sentences.

Consistent layout and navigation barrier
: **Problem:** I get confused when I go to a new page and the layout and navigation are different.
: **Works well:** When there is a consistent "look" to the pages on a site, I can learn where things are.

Heading structure barrier
: **Problem:** Long pages that are not broken up into sections are hard to read and understand.
: **Works well:** Descriptive headings that are styled like an outline help me to find what I want and better understand the content.

Moving or blinking content barrier
: **Problem:** Moving or blinking content is very distracting and I can't remember what I wanted to do.
: **Works well:** It's best when sites don't use moving or blinking content but if they do, let me turn it off.
