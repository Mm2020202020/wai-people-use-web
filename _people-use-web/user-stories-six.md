## Martine, older adult student who is hard of hearing

> Most people don't realise that sign language is a completely different language. I can read text but it is hard as I am always translating from my native language. While she can hear some sounds, she does not hear enough to understand speech.

Martine is 62 years old and is a mature student, taking online courses. She has been hard of hearing since birth. She learned to lip read as a young child. The university where Martine studies provides sign language interpreters and Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART); however, this captioning is not always present on video and other media content. When someone is speaking on screen, she can lip read, however a lot of the content has audio tracks over imagery, making it hard for her to follow without captions.

The university is now working to caption all content across their curriculum, however it is a lengthy process. As more and more content is captioned, Martine is finding it easier to complete her studies remotely.

Martine spends a lot of her free time watching streamed content on video streaming services. The improvement in captioning on these services in recent years has meant she is able to watch more programmes than she was before. She can have difficulty when captions aren't clearly color coded to show who is speaking. Auto-captioning can be useful for her bit it can also cause her problems if it's available but incorrect.

Martine prefers written content to have good structure and headings with minimal jargon.

### Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies used

* [Captions (Perception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#perception)
* [Transcripts (Perception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#perception)
* [Sign language (Presentation)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#presentation)

### Barrier examples

Inaccurate captions
: **Problem:** I love that my classes are recorded and available online but sometimes the captions don't convey the exact words that the instructor is saying, especially in some of my more technical classes.
: **Works well:** When the captioner gets to know the material so they don't miss words or make mistakes.

Design of captions
: **Problem:** When watching movies online, the captions often appear on top of the video. This obscures the video and makes the captions hard to read over a background that is constantly changing.
: **Works well:** Captions appear at the bottom of the screen against a solid color background that offers good contrast between the captions and background.

Good camera position for speaker
: **Problem:** Some classes record the instructor speaking. This is great because I am good at lip reading but the camera is often too far away.
: **Works well:** The camera is positioned to focus in on the instructor's face.

No alternative for audio
: **Problem:** When watching a news program online, there isn't an option for me to understand what the speaker is saying.
: **Works well:** Provide audio alternatives such as sign language, captions or transcript. If there is a speaker in camera, focus in on the speaker.
