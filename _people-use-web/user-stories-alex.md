## Alex, reporter with repetative stress injury

> It's not like I can't use a keyboard or mouse, I just can't use it for long periods and really like to keep my use to a minimum. I don't want my condition to get worse.

Alex has worked as a reporter for more than 20 years. A few years ago he developed a repetitive strain injury that makes it painful to use a mouse and to type for extended periods of time.

Alex can still do his job but sometimes he finds it tiring and painful when he uses the mouse for long periods of time. He uses an ergonomic keyboard to navigate around web pages and has found that this helps alleviate the pain associated with using the mouse. This works well when he can see which field or link has focus and when they are in a logical order. Sites often include good visual styling when you hover over a link but not when it has keyboard focus. When this happens he loses his place on the page.

Using the keyboard does help but Alex tries to limit that as much as possible. If there is no way to skip all the navigation he has to tab through a lot of links in the header, which is very tiring and limits the time he can spend working comfortably. Alex uses voice control software which helps him to avoid using the mouse and keyboard. The software allows him to select and 'click' on links with his voice but only when the links are clear and coded correctly. Alex seldom uses the dictation part of his voice control software when writing articles. He still prefers to type as it suits how he thinks about his work.

Outside of work, Alex finds his mobile device easier to use than the computer because there is limited navigation, no pointer device, and because it is hand-held, he can usually find a comfortable position. He wishes his employer would create a mobile-friendly/responsive site that he could use for his job.

* [Skip links (Interation)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#interaction)

### Barrier examples

**Problem:** When I tab through links and form fields there is no visual styling to show me which element I am on.

**Works well:** There is clear and strong visual styling for links and form fields when they receive focus.

**Problem:** I usually take much longer to complete long forms or processes and often get timed out.

**Works well:** At the start of a long form or process, I am told that there is a time out and given the option to set it to be slightly longer.

**Problem:** Completing a long forms with no way to save progress and take a break can be painful and tiring.

**Words well:** I have an option to save progress and take a break when completing long, multi-step forms.

**Problem:** When a window opens and I can't close it using only the keyboard it can be difficult.

**Works well:** New windows have a close icon that I can access using the keyboard and some include the option to press the escape key to close them.
