## About Allen

> It's not like I can't use a keyboard or mouse, I just can't use it for long periods and really like to keep my use to a minimum. I don't want my condition to get worse.

Allen has worked as a reporter for more than 20 years. He recently developed a repetitive strain injury that makes it painful to use a mouse and to type for extended periods of time. 

Allen has changed how he works to use the mouse less. He uses an ergonomic keyboard to navigate around web pages and has found that this helps alleviate the pain associated with using the mouse. He can do his job but still finds it tiring and painful when performing repeated or prolonged activity. He also found that when he couldn't see which field or link had focus or when they weren't in a logical order he had to use his mouse again making things worse. Sites often include good visual styling when you hover over a link but not when it has keyboard focus.

Since moving to using a keyboard more Allen has found some features which really help. For example, a skip link that moves focus past all the navigation is a big help. Allen is beginning to avoid sites that don't have this feature which is limiting some of research sources.

Allen has started using speech control software which helps him to avoid using the mouse and keyboard but it is early days and he is not sure of how to use all the features. The software allows him to select and 'click' on links by speaking but only when the links are clear and coded correctly. The software also has a speech-to-text dictation feature. As someone who has spent years typing out his articles Allen is having to train himself in a new way of working. He would still prefer to type as he thinks he is much slower with dictation but is hopeful that his speed will improve.

Outside of work, Allen finds his mobile device easier to use than the computer because there is limited navigation, no pointer device, and because it is hand-held, he can usually find a comfortable position. He wishes his employer would create a mobile-friendly/responsive site that he could use for his job.

2. Dragon out of the box will have better ways to support navigation. Speech is much faster

## Barrier examples

Focus styling barrier
: **Problem:** "When I tab through links and form fields there is no visual styling to show me which element I am on."
: **Works well:** "There is clear and strong visual styling for links and form fields when they receive focus."

Process time outs barrier
: **Problem:** "I usually take much longer to complete long forms or processes and often get timed out."
: **Works well:** "At the start of a long form or process, I am told that there is a time out and given the option to set it to be slightly longer."

Saving progress barrier
: **Problem:** "Completing long forms with no way to save progress and take a break can be painful and tiring."
: **Words well:** "I have an option to save progress and take a break when completing long, multi-step forms like when I have to get a code in email or text and type it in."

Popup windows barrier
: **Problem:** "When a window opens and I can't close it using only the keyboard it can be difficult."
: **Works well:** "New windows have a close icon that I can access using the keyboard and some include the option to press the escape key to close them."
