## Translation Notes

The title "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" is a statement. The title is **not a question**. For translation, it might help to think of the title "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" as **a shorter version of** "An Introduction to How People with Disabilities Use the Web" or "Description of How People with Disabilities Use the Web".
